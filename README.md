# Phasmobobia AntiMod Bypass  
  
This is just a small dll that disables the checks Phasmophobia uses to detect modding  
  
Tried with BepInEx/Doorstop, AND MelonLoader !  

# IMPORTANT
This bypass was made by [Cr4nkSt4r](https://github.com/Cr4nkSt4r)
I want to continue this bypass if the creator at some point doesn't have time to update it.
