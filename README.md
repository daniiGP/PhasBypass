# Phasmobobia AntiMod Bypass  
  
This is just a small dll that disables the checks Phasmophobia uses to detect modding  
  
Tried with BepInEx/Doorstop, AND MelonLoader ! 

# IMPORTANT
This bypass was made by [Cr4nkSt4r](https://github.com/Cr4nkSt4r)
I want to continue this bypass if the creator at some point doesn't have time to update it.
If the game crashes you can try the new bypass that Cr4nkSt4r has worked on, [Reworked Bypass](https://github.com/Cr4nkSt4r/PhasBypass_reworked/releases/tag/Beta)
